# CS5001EvolutionaryComputing

This Repository contains the algorithms discussed in the Evolutionary Computing Course offered in Shiv Nadar University Chennai to the M.Tech in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science Course.

## Unit 1: Search Algorithms

The algorithms discussed in this unit have been implemented as follows:

1. British Museum Search
2. Breadth-First Search
3. Depth First Search
4. Hill Climb Algorithm
5. Oracle
6. Beam Search
7. Branch and Bound(4 Variations)
8. A*
9. Best First Search

All the algorithms have been individually defined in separate files. A menu-driven program has been written in the 'pipeline.py' file in which a graph can be inputted and based on the algorithm selected, a path will be returned.


## Unit 2: Optimization Algorithms

A Whitebox Neural Network has been implemented in this unit, along with different Activation Functions and the Various Optimization Techniques discussed in Class.

### Activation Functions

1. Sigmoid
2. Tanh
5. ReLU
6. ELU
7. PReLU
8. Leaky Relu
9. SELU
10. SoftSign
11. SoftPlus
12. Hard Sigmoid
13. Swish
14. Mish
Apart from the Above 14 Activation Functions, all students were asked to design their own Activation Functions with any range and mathematical model.
