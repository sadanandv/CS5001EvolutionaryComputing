# CS5001EvolutionaryComputing

This Repository contains the algorithms discussed in the Evolutionary Computing Course offered in Shiv Nadar University Chennai to the M.Tech in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science Course.

## Unit 1: Search Algorithms

The algorithms discussed in this unit have been implemented as follows:

1. British Museum Search
2. Breadth-First Search
3. Depth First Search
4. Hill Climb Algorithm
5. Oracle
6. Beam Search
7. Branch and Bound(4 Variations)
8. A*
9. Best First Search

All the algorithms have been individually defined in separate files. A menu-driven program has been written in the 'pipeline.py' file in which a graph can be inputted and based on the algorithm selected, a path will be returned.

A C++ version of the pipeline has also been included in the directory.

## Unit 2: Optimization Algorithms

A Whitebox Neural Network has been implemented in this unit, along with different Activation Functions and the Various Optimization Techniques discussed in Class.

### Activation Functions

1. Sigmoid
2. Softmax
3. Relu
4. Leaky Relu
