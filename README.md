# CS5001EvolutionaryComputing

This Repository contains the algorithms discussed in the Evolutionary Computing Course offered in Shiv Nadar University Chennai to the M.Tech in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science Course.

## Unit 1: Search Algorithms

The algorithms discussed in this unit have been implemented as follows:

i. British Muesum Search

ii. Breadth First Search

iii. Depth First Search

iv. Hill Climb Algorithm

v. Oracle

vi. Beam Search

vii. Branch and Bound(4 Variations)

viii. A*

ix. Best First Search

All the algorithms have been individually defined in separate files. A menu-driven program has been written in the 'pipeline.py' file in which a graph can be inputted and based on the algorithm selected, a path will be returned.

A C++ version of the pipeline has also been included in the directory.
